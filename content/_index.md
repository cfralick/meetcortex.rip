## What was [Cortex Automation](https://web.archive.org/web/20230209000946/https://www.meetcortex.com/)? 
Cortex was a social media analytics tool that provided advanced metrics on your competitors' Facebook pages.

#### Origin
The project that became Cortex was founded in late 2012 and added its first paying customers in 2013.

#### Theft
In 2014, [Brennan White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennanwhite) and [Matt Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattkpeters) stole it and renamed it Cortex. They started claiming it was an "AI" because that made it easier to dupe people into subscribing or investing and hired one developer to make Cortex show customers fake data, and another who copied source code belonging to his previous employer into Cortex and spent years trying to copy [Buffer](https://buffer.com). 

Investors including Jere Doyle and Techstars Boston knew Cortex was a sham and gave them money anyway. Journalists knew Matt and Brennan had lied to them and ignored it.

#### Foundering
After Cortex finished Techstars, it released a complete redesign, which was terribly designed and frequently just returned gibberish. No one at the company noticed that while they were working on this amateurish new version:
* most of the major social networks started restricting API access
* Companies like OpenAI started releasing products that, to say the least, didn't return unintelligible gibberish

Cortex lost 80% of its revenue in 3 years. In 2022, against projected revenues of $6,000,000, actual revenue was $250,000. Cortex shut down in 2023. It has not returned the software itvstole to its owner.
