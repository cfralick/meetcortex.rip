For almost 10 years, self-styoled founders of [Cortex Automation](http://meetcortex.com) [Brennan White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennanwhite) and [Matt Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattkpeters) fabricated data, defrauded their customers, and misled their investors. The entire business was a sham. 

Hanna Green reported [Cortex's](http://www.meetcortex.com) foundering ([An AI startup from Techstars Boston's class of 2020 shuts down](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/inno/stories/news/2023/05/04/cortex-automation-shuts-down.html)) for BostInno.

[Cortex](http://www.meetcortex.com) may be the only startup to graduate from Techstars and then promptly loose half
their revenue two years in a row.
